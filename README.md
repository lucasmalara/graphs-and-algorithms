# GRAPHS AND ALGORITHMS

<p align="justify">
The project is built using <b>Maven</b> for project management and the code is written in <b>Java 14</b>.
</p>

Versions:
- `1.0-beta` - For diploma thesis
- `1.0` - Latest stable release

## Purpose

The project was focused on:

- implementation of unweighted undirected graphs that cannot have multiple edges nor loops.
- implementation of chosen algorithms involved with graph structures.

<p align="justify">
Initially, the project was created to the needs of my diploma thesis 
<i>'Algorithmic aspects of domination problem in graphs'</i>, where I included implementation of <b>approximation algorithm</b> 
for computing <b>maximum connected dominating set</b> of given graph. The implementation of the algorithm required defining 
specific data structure. Despite possibility to use already accessible data structures in Java, I decided to implement the 
structure myself in case of possible improvements and changes I could be willing to deploy - hence I defined Graph class. 
The next case was to decide about vertex implementation. And simply because of an idea: <i>what if there would be a need 
for each or some vertex to store multiple values?</i> - I decided to create a Vertex class as well. However, it was 
important to me to keep it simple for a user. Thus, I decided that Vertex should be an inner non-static class of Graph, 
so the user do not have to worry about having an object instance and use only a number as a reference. To make it possible, 
I implemented methods that map numbers to vertex objects and the other way.
<br>
<br>
After a graduation, I decided to improve the quality of written code and add new features. However, my goal was to keep
the assumption about the implementation I determined in <code>1.0-beta</code> project version. Therefore, I didn't 
implement palpable representation of edges, since the implementation of <b>vertex neighbourhood</b> was satisfactory 
in such case. The outcome of my work has been committed on this repository.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, it is recommended to add an **environment variable** to the **run configuration**:

`ALLOW`
and set its value to `true` or `false` - depending on wanted behaviour.

```
if(ALLOW) -> runs basic and exceptions test of Graph implementation
else -> runs only basic test of Graph implementation
```

_Note that if you do not add environment variable to run configuration of a project you can expect to run the basic test only._
